# Site DropBox replica version 2
## developed in 1440px.
### to view the structure correctly the minimum resolution is equal to or geater than: â‰¤ 1440px


## any main section in container of 1440px has max-width 930px EXEPT FOR Nav(which does not have a max-width) and div.jumbotron(which has a max-width of 1000px) 

### a style sheet called css debug has been inserted into the HTML structure.
this was initially used to structure the page by inserting colored blocks, heights and borders to divide each part of the page such as the header, main footer and each part inside these macro areas.
by inserting the debug class in the Body tag you can see the structure with the edges that serve to understand how the structure was developed,

# The structure is not responsive; were not used: mediaquery, display flex or display grid technology was not used. Float was used for the row and column layout.
